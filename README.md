Simulation of incentivizing peers in a p2p network.
In this repo, the work that was done by me is the network.py, gas_fees.py and P2Panalysis jupyter notebook. The rest of the code is the work of Nikhil Sharma https://github.com/n1ck47 , that was necessary in order for the simulation to run. 
My work includes creating a properly connected network, retrieving the live gas fees from the real time and analyzing the data and gain insights from them and check the effectiveness of the protocol.
